AnimatedImage(

)()
```

<Callout>
This component uses `<canvas>` to draw freeze frames, so images are subject to [cross-origin restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image).

## Examples

### WEBP Images

Both GIF and WEBP images are supported.

```scala preview h-[310px]
AnimatedImage(
  _.src := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/tie.webp",
  _.alt := "Animation of a shoe being tied"
)()
```

### Setting a Width and Height

To set a custom size, apply a width and/or height to the host element.

```scala preview h-[240px]
AnimatedImage(
  _.src   := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif",
  _.alt   := "Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement",
  _.style := "width: 150px; height: 200px;"
)()
```

### Customizing the Control Box

You can change the appearance and location of the control box by targeting the `control-box` part in your styles.

```css forId="animated-image-custom-control-box" show
.animated-image-custom-control-box::part(control-box) {
  top: auto;
  right: auto;
  bottom: 1rem;
  left: 1rem;
  background-color: deeppink;
  border: none;
  color: pink;
}
```

```scala preview id="animated-image-custom-control-box" h-[520px]
AnimatedImage(
  _.src := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif",
  _.alt := "Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
)(
  cls := "animated-image-custom-control-box"
)
```
